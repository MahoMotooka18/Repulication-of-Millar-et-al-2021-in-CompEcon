Lab Section 4: Consumption-Saving Problem

Implementation of deep learning solutions for the consumption-saving problem
as described in "Deep learning for solving dynamic economic models" 
(Maliar, Maliar, Winant, 2021, JME), Section 4.

Includes three training objectives:
1. Lifetime reward maximization
2. Euler equation residuals (with Fischer-Burmeister complementarity)
3. Bellman equation residuals

Supports neural networks of sizes 8x8, 16x16, 32x32, and 64x64.
